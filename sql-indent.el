;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `sqlind-minor-mode' is a minor mode that enables syntax-based indentation
;; for `sql-mode' buffers: the TAB key indents the current line based on the
;; SQL code on previous lines.  To setup syntax-based indentation for every
;; SQL buffer, add `sqlind-minor-mode' to `sql-mode-hook'.  Indentation rules
;; are flexible and can be customized to match your personal coding style.
;; For more information, see the "sql-indent.org" file.
;;
;; The package also defines align rules so that the `align' function works for
;; SQL statements, see `sqlind-align-rules'.

;;; Code:

(require 'sql)
(require 'cl-lib)

  "Syntax table used in `sql-mode' for indenting SQL code.
This is slightly different than the syntax table used for
navigation: some punctuation characters are made symbol
constituents so that syntactic navigation works over them.")

;;;; Utilities

;; The following routines perform rudimentary syntactical analysis of SQL
;; code.  The indentation engine decides how to indent based on what this code
;; returns.  The main function is `sqlind-syntax-of-line'.
;;
;; To examine the syntax of the current line, you can use the
;; `sqlind-show-syntax-of-line'.  This is only useful if you want to debug this
;; package or are just curious.

  "This variable exists just for its documentation.

The the SQL parsing code returns a syntax definition (either a
symbol or a list) and an anchor point, which is a buffer
position.  The syntax symbols can be used to define how to indent
each line, see `sqlind-indentation-offsets-alist'

The following syntax symbols are defined for SQL code:

- (syntax-error MESSAGE START END) -- this is returned when the
  parse failed.  MESSAGE is an informative message, START and END
  are buffer locations denoting the problematic region.  ANCHOR
  is undefined for this syntax info

- in-comment -- line is inside a multi line comment, ANCHOR is
  the start of the comment.

- comment-start -- line starts with a comment.  ANCHOR is the
  start of the enclosing block.

- in-string -- line is inside a string, ANCHOR denotes the start
  of the string.

- toplevel -- line is at toplevel (not inside any programming
  construct).  ANCHOR is usually (point-min).

- (in-block BLOCK-KIND LABEL) -- line is inside a block
  construct.  BLOCK-KIND (a symbol) is the actual block type and
  can be one of \"if\", \"case\", \"exception\", \"loop\" etc.
  If the block is labeled, LABEL contains the label.  ANCHOR is
  the start of the block.

- (in-begin-block KIND LABEL) -- line is inside a block started
  by a begin statement.  KIND (a symbol) is \"toplevel-block\"
  for a begin at toplevel, \"defun\" for a begin that starts the
  body of a procedure or function, \"package\" for a begin that
  starts the body of a package, or nil for a begin that is none
  of the previous.  For a \"defun\" or \"package\", LABEL is the
  name of the procedure, function or package, for the other block
  types LABEL contains the block label, or the empty string if
  the block has no label.  ANCHOR is the start of the block.

- (block-start KIND) -- line begins with a statement that starts
  a block.  KIND (a symbol) can be one of \"then\", \"else\" or
  \"loop\".  ANCHOR is the reference point for the block
  start (the coresponding if, case, etc).

- (block-end KIND LABEL) -- the line contains an end statement.
  KIND (a symbol) is the type of block we are closing, LABEL (a
  string) is the block label (or procedure name for an end
  defun).

- declare-statement -- line is after a declare keyword, but
  before the begin.  ANCHOR is the start of the declare
  statement.

- (package NAME) -- line is inside a package definition.  NAME is
  the name of the package, ANCHOR is the start of the package.

- (package-body NAME) -- line is inside a package body.  NAME is
  the name of the package, ANCHOR is the start of the package
  body.

- (create-statement WHAT NAME) -- line is inside a CREATE
  statement (other than create procedure or function).  WHAT is
  the thing being created, NAME is its name.  ANCHOR is the start
  of the create statement.

- (defun-start NAME) -- line is inside a procedure of function
  definition but before the begin block that starts the body.
  NAME is the name of the procedure/function, ANCHOR is the start
  of the procedure/function definition.

The following SYNTAX-es are for SQL statements.  For all of
them ANCHOR points to the start of a statement itself.

- labeled-statement-start -- line is just after a label.

- statement-continuation -- line is inside a statement which
  starts on a previous line.

- nested-statement-open -- line is just inside an opening
  bracket, but the actual bracket is on a previous line.

- nested-statement-continuation -- line is inside an opening
  bracket, but not the first element after the bracket.

- nested-statement-close -- line is inside an opening bracket and
  the line contains the closing bracket as the first character.

The following SYNTAX-es are for statements which are SQL
code (DML statements).  They are pecialisations on the previous
statement syntaxes and for all of them a previous generic
statement syntax is present earlier in the SYNTAX list.  Unless
otherwise specified, ANCHOR points to the start of the
clause (select, from, where, etc) in which the current point is.

- with-clause -- line is inside a WITH clause, but before the
  main SELECT clause.

- with-clause-cte -- line is inside a with clause before a
  CTE (common table expression) declaration

- with-clause-cte-cont -- line is inside a with clause before a
  CTE definition

- case-clause -- line is on a CASE expression (WHEN or END
  clauses).  ANCHOR is the start of the CASE expression.

- case-clause-item -- line is on a CASE expression (THEN and ELSE
  clauses).  ANCHOR is the position of the case clause.

- case-clause-item-cont -- line is on a CASE expression but not
  on one of the CASE sub-keywords.  ANCHOR points to the case
  keyword that this line is a continuation of.

- select-clause -- line is inside a select statement, right
  before one of its clauses (from, where, order by, etc).

- select-column -- line is inside the select column section,
  after a full column was defined (and a new column definition is
  about to start).

- select-column-continuation -- line is inside the select column
  section, but in the middle of a column definition.  The defined
  column starts on a previous like.  Note that ANCHOR still
  points to the start of the select statement itself.

- select-join-condition -- line is right before or just after the ON clause
  for an INNER, LEFT or RIGHT join.  ANCHOR points to the join statement
  for which the ON is defined.

- select-table -- line is inside the from clause, just after a
  table was defined and a new one is about to start.

- select-table-continuation -- line is inside the from clause,
  inside a table definition which starts on a previous line. Note
  that ANCHOR still points to the start of the select statement
  itself.

- (in-select-clause CLAUSE) -- line is inside the select CLAUSE,
  which can be \"where\", \"order by\", \"group by\" or
  \"having\".  Note that CLAUSE can never be \"select\" and
  \"from\", because we have special syntaxes inside those
  clauses.

- insert-clause -- line is inside an insert statement, right
  before one of its clauses (values, select).

- (in-insert-clause CLAUSE) -- line is inside the insert CLAUSE,
  which can be \"insert into\" or \"values\".

- delete-clause -- line is inside a delete statement right before
  one of its clauses.

- (in-delete-clause CLAUSE) -- line is inside a delete CLAUSE,
  which can be \"delete from\" or \"where\".

- update-clause -- line is inside an update statement right
  before one of its clauses.

- (in-update-clause CLAUSE) -- line is inside an update CLAUSE,
  which can be \"update\", \"set\" or \"where\".")
